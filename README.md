Welcome to my project for CSE! With this, you can control a PC with an Arduino! All you need is the app, made in [MIT App Inventor](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu) and an Arduino that can communicate over USB. Don't worry if you don't have a Leonardo, since you can use the 16u2 on an Uno or Mega for this. It's even what I used!

Requirements:
* Arduino with 8u2, 16u2, or 32u2
* [HID Project](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID)
* [HoodLoader2](https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2) (If using Uno or Mega)
* [HC-06 or HC-05 Bluetooth module](http://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=AS_20151116112408&SearchText=arduino+bluetooth) (or anything else that does Bluetooth to serial)
* Android device

Setup Instructions:
* Download the APK to your device
* Setup your Arduino
* Pair your device with your Arduino
* Enjoy!
